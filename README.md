# Rainfall

Another security project this time aiming towards reverse engineering of C code.

### VM Install
Using virtualBox

1) Create a network adapter
2) Create your vm, select your os (linux 64bit) but don't input any iso for now.
3) Do the usual disk stuff
4) "settings" -> "network" -> set "attached to" to "bridged adapter"
5) Launch the VM
6) When asked, enter the ISO path and reboot.
